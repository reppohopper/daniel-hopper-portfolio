    <h1>About</h1>
    <img src="assets/portrait.jpg" alt="Headshot of Daniel Hopper" class="profile" />

    <p>I’m a software engineer with a background in building practical tools and global scale business automation in the managed IT services space. Professionally my blend of IT team leadership and software experience aligns well with Web Developer, Business Workflow Automation, or Solutions Engineer/Field Applications Engineer roles. </p>

    <p>I started my self-taught journey in web development in 2012, attempting to recreate a childhood favorite video game (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade). Though I studied music and English literature in college, I'm continually driven to programming by a love of the activity of creating. Since then I've developed my software skills continually on the job and at home, most recently rounding out my humanities education with community college courses like Data Structures and Algorithms and Mobile Development at LWTech. I'm most interested in building applications and technology that either improve productivity, or are aimed at learning or improving a skill. And all the better if it can feel gamified and internally rewarding. </p>

    <p>Professionally, I value impact-motivated work pursuits and decisionmaking, empathy in communication, high ownership, continuous growth. Tactically I prefer to make heavy use of metrics and feedback, and continuously eliminate unnecessarily stressful elements of work processes though automations and  improvements</p>

    <p>Outside of engineering I enjoy reading, weight training and endurance sports,  games, finding or cooking good food, and spending intentional quality time with my family and friends. I’m currently learning Mandarin, developing more projects, and training for new powerlifting goals and mobility targets. </p>
